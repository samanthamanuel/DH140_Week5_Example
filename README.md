# Final-Project-Related Assignment 1


**Possible Project Proposals**

1. *Tate CSV File From the CORGIS Dataset Project.*(Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1500 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art. I'm intrested in comparing their collection of women artists to men artists or noting the types of artworks they have acquired.)

2. *The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection from Github.* (I'm specifically intrested in analyzing MoMA's Artist's Dataset which contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection. I'm intrested in looking at the nationality and gender of the artists they are collecting.)

3. *KaoKore Dataset from Github* (KaoKore is a novel dataset of face images from Japanese illustrations along with multiple labels for each face, derived from the Collection of Facial Expressions. I'd like to explore the data sets categories on gender and social status.)



**Data and viz of interest**

1. [AI Art and Data Science](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney)

    * I'm intrested in learning more about programs like Lensa or DALLâ€¢E 2, specifically the issues regarding authorship, legitimacy, and privacy. ((edit)) Intitally I was intrested in pursuing this, but I realize now that there is not a lot of information on this field of study so I will no longer be pursuing this.

2. ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

* I would like to learn how to make word clouds because I find that they are visually compelling and help with gathering quick key takeaways. 



**Ideas for data to investigate**

1. List of humanities topics that interest me
    * Art History
    * Literature 
    * Music 


2. Week 2's Data & Python Fundamentals, specifically the article "Computer Programming as an Art" 


3. Data Sets and Articles
